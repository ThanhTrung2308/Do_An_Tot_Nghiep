If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.\n\n> **PANDAS :**\n> - **Reference link for Pandas :** https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html \n    - Pandas provide high performance, fast, easy to use data structures and data analysis tools for manipulating numeric data and time series. Pandas is built on the numpy library and written in languages like Python, Cython, and C. In pandas, we can import data from various file formats like JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel, etc.\n>    \n**NUMPY:**\n> - **Reference link for Numpy :**  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/\n       - It is the fundamental library of python, used to perform scientific computing. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and tools to deal with them. A numpy array is a grid of values (of the same type) that are indexed by a tuple of positive integers, numpy arrays are fast, easy to understand, and give users the right to perform calculations across arrays.\n       \n       \n ### Data Visualizations\n - Data Visualization is the graphic representation of data. It converts a huge dataset into small graphs, thus aids in data analysis and predictions\n       \n**MATPLOTLIB**\n>-**Reference link for Matplotlib :** https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/index.html\n- It is a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of other libraries like Numpy and Pandas. It is a powerful tool for visualizing data in Python. It is used for creating statical interferences and plotting 2D graphs of arrays\n\n**SEABORN:**\n> - **Reference link for Seaborn :** https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html\n- It is also a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. It is built on the roof of Matplotlib and is considered as a superset of the Matplotlib library. It helps in visualizing univariate and bivariate data\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import the Modules needed ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"  # Web
